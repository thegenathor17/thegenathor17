# Nahum Naranjo — InCGames

**Building slow. Thinking sharp. Making things that leave a mark.**

I’m Nahum — indie game developer, storyteller, and web tinkerer.

I build games that don’t just entertain — they sit with you.  
I build websites that aren’t loud, but make you stay.  
Design and code are just different ways of telling the truth.

## 🚧 Currently
- Working on **Jade Tears** — a 2D narrative-driven action game where your choices cut deeper than your sword.
- Developing **thegenathor17.github.io** — a web blog where I document everything I learn.
- Building a **A Galactic Odyssey** — a 2D tech-driven space game where you manage a space agency in a random galaxy.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> Code is my language. Games are my essays.   
> I don’t chase fun — I chase meaning.  
> Sometimes it's a game, sometimes it's a page, but it's always a reflection.  
> If it doesn’t feel honest, I scrap it.

Sometimes I break stuff on purpose to see what happens.
